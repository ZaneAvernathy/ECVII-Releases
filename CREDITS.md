# Special thanks

This project is the result of long brainstorming sessions with Smilies, elise, and Two Who Belong. Thanks to Arch, L95, Doc, bookofholsety, and many more. Thank you to Ultimage, nat5, and the many wizards who inspire me.

Thank you Miacis, Ultimage, Cirosan, Kirb, and others whose love of FE5 lead to much of the research that was conducted in tandem with the development of this project.

Past contributors whose work has since been superseded include but are not limited to:
  - kb for his early Serra portrait
